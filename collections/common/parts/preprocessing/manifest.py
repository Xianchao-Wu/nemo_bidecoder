    """Iterate through json lines of provided manifests.

    NeMo ASR pipelines often assume certain manifest files structure. In
    particular, each manifest file should consist of line-per-sample files with
    each line being correct json dict. Each such json dict should have a field
    for audio file string, a field for duration float and a field for text
    string. Offset also could be additional field and is set to None by
    default.

    Args:
        manifests_files: Either single string file or list of such -
            manifests to yield items from.

        parse_func: A callable function which accepts as input a single line
            of a manifest and optionally the manifest file itself,
            and parses it, returning a dictionary mapping from str -> Any.

    Yields:
        Parsed key to value item dicts.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If met invalid json line structure.
